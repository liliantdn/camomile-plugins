# camomile-plugins
Some plugins created with pure data and camomile (this repo is still a work in progress).

Eventually I wanna rebuild these plugins outside of pd to have more control over the ui and such but it's easier to mess around and try stuff with pd for now.

## METAL BOX
Reverb plugin made up of four delays feeding into eachother. It is meant to create resonant, metallic sounds.

> **Todo:**
>- Add pre/post highpass and lowpass (the only reason I haven't done this yet it because I wanna a find a way to do it without cluttering the ui).
>- Find better names for some of the sliders?

## Widener
Originally made this as a part of metal box, it's a "stereo widener" that uses two comb filters to make stuff stereo without messing up the mono too much
